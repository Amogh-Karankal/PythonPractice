##Python Program for QuickSort

#Recursive

# This implementation utilizes pivot as the last element in the nums list
# It has a pointer to keep track of the elements smaller than the pivot
# At the very end of partition() function, the pointer is swapped with the pivot
# to come up with a "sorted" nums relative to the pivot
